# Personal Projects
    A varied assortment of personal projects I have created both in and out of school. 


### ItunesAPIApp
    Developed using Java and JavaFX, displays a grid of album covers based on inputting genre you are searching for. Images on the grid are randomly selected to be updated with another album cover on a timed basis. Implemented by pulling iTunes API and multithreading the application for best performance.

### Matrix
    Developed in C++. Simple application for a matrix and performing operations upon that matrix.


### MineSweeper
    Simple, linux command line based minesweeper game with full functionality.

### Webscraping
    Simple file for practice webscraping. As of now, can use to search youtube and go directly to website.
